# Portfolio

This is a collection example of previous work I have worked on that I can not provide the code for.

While at Retinize I was working on a Networked VR Animation tool called Animotive.

VRoomstick was a devision of Keith Drury Art that focused on VR.
I have archived their projects I worked as their site is no longer active, as they no longer persue this field.
