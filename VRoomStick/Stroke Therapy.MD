Stroke Therapy
Spring 2020

Stroke patients often have impaired physical functions and find it difficult to cope when they return home to 'real life'. Practising everyday activities in a virtual environment before leaving hospital can help to facilitate this transition as they re-adjust to the relentless demands imposed by daily life. 

VRoomstick is currently working with neuroconsultants and specialist clinical occupational therapists to create a range of immersive in-door and outdoor scenes to assist stroke patients on their journey to recovery.

This pilot VR programme will support patients undergoing rehabilitation as they begin to recover basic locomotory functions, rebuild muscle strength and regain cognitive ability.
