Autism Project

This VR programme is part of a doctoral research study at Queen’s University Belfast. The objective is to empower children and young adults on the ASD spectrum who experience Intolerance to Uncertainty (IU) and/or Preference for Sameness (PfS) where they crave routine in order to function in their daily lives.

VRoomstick created a range of immersive games-based virtual activities situated in ‘real world’ contexts including: a street scene, a cafe, a supermarket and an airport. Deliberately built-in challenges (known as ‘wrongality’) disrupt the scenes and then provide coping mechanisms which include compromise solutions. 

By experiencing virtual exposure to unexpected events and then being offered alternative choices, children feel empowered to cope with real world disruption and overcome anxieties they normally associate with change.
