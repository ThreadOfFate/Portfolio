White Dove Way Project
Spring 2019

Based on Jane Morrice’s* White Dove Way concept, inspired by Columbanus and modelled on the EU Peace Programme, this pilot initiative commissioned VRoomstick to create a virtual European ‘Path of Peace’ from Northern Ireland to Nicosia following in the footsteps of Columbanus, passing through areas profoundly affected by war and conflict. The virtual path of peace challenged participants to experience cultural difference by experiencing various scenes which touched on issues of identity, diversity and conflict resolution.

*Jane Morrice was Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, founder of the NI Women’s Coalition and is now a member of the European Economic and Social Committee.
