Virtual Reality Therapy can facilitate the treatment of disorders or phobias where the irrational fear of something can lead to feelings of anxiety or panic. Common examples include: acrophobia (exaggerated fear of heights), arachnophobia (exaggerated fear of spiders) and claustrophobia (exaggerated fear of confined spaces).

Some feared situations are hard to re-create in real world settings in a safe way that is able to initiate a path to recovery. With the use of Virtual Reality, it is possible to simulate situations that cause anxiety but which may be difficult, or even impossible, to replicate physically where the participant retains absolute control and is able to manage exposure to their fear.

Following an initial evaluation, VRoomstick can tailor a VR programme of treatment based on specially designed immersive content which will gauge an appropriate start level according to the patientâ€™s phobia. During the sessions, the therapist will change the level of challenge according to the patient's progress, gradually building confidence and fostering resilience, until the treatment's conclusion. As the patient overcomes these various hurdles, the resultant feeling of self-empowerment will help to enable them to overcome anxiety issues pertinent to their specific fears.
